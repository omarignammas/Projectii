# Projectii

**A full-stack coursework workspace** — courses, tasks, a calendar, and synchronized Pomodoro Focus Rooms with friends, all in one place.

Started as a generic project/task manager and evolved into a student-focused study tool: track courses and assignments, run Kanban boards per term, hold live co-working sessions with friends over WebSockets, and see it all summarized with real-time stats.

The landing page also ships its own animated product tour (`components/landing/ScreensShowcase.jsx`) built from the same design tokens and components as the real app, auto-cycling through the screens above.

## Features

**Courses & Tasks**
- Courses grouped by term, each with its own progress ring
- Tasks with priority, type, due date, and course tagging
- List view or a full drag-and-drop Kanban board (To Do / Overdue / Done, overdue computed from due date)
- Calendar view of every due date across all courses

**Focus Rooms**
- Create a room with a shareable join code, or invite friends directly
- Optionally schedule a room for later
- Server-authoritative synchronized Pomodoro timer (work / break / long break phases) shared by every participant
- Live in-room chat, locked to reactions during a focus block; hand-raise signal
- Rematch a completed room to start a fresh session with the same group

**Friends & Notifications**
- Send, accept, or decline friend requests
- Real-time in-app notifications over a dedicated WebSocket connection (friend requests, room invites) with a bell dropdown and unread count

**Notes**
- Save a note directly, or paste an article URL and have its readable text fetched and stored server-side (Jsoup) so it's available inside the app, not just an outbound link

**Stats & Profile**
- Completion trends and daily focus-hours trend (last 14 days), per-course completion rings, priority breakdown
- Editable profile with a real avatar upload (validated, stored on disk, served statically — no third-party storage dependency)
- Full dark/light theme support

```

**Real-time design:** two independent STOMP connections rather than one shared client. Focus Rooms use a per-room connection where the server owns all state (phase timing, round count, chat) and broadcasts the full room snapshot on every change — the client never computes timer state itself beyond a local countdown display. Notifications use a second, session-wide connection subscribed to a per-user queue, so they arrive on any page, not just inside a room.

---

## Getting Started

### Option A — Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarignammas/Projectii.git
cd Projectii
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in real values
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
- Postgres: localhost:5432 (persisted in the `postgres-data` volume)

### Option B — Run manually

**Backend** (needs a local PostgreSQL database named in `application.properties`, or override via env vars — see below):

```bash
cd backendProjecty
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontendProjecty
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

Everything is overridable via environment variables, with sensible local defaults baked in so the app runs out of the box without any `.env` file. See `.env.example` (Docker Compose) and `frontendProjecty/.env.example` (Vite):

| Variable | Used by | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` / `_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD` | Backend | Local Postgres on `localhost:5432` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` / `JWT_EXPIRATION` | Backend | A dev-only key checked into `application.properties` — **override this in any real deployment** |
| `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Backend | `http://localhost:3000` — comma-separated for multiple origins |
| `APP_UPLOADS_DIR` | Backend | `uploads` (avatar storage location) |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Frontend | `http://localhost:8080` |

---

## Testing

Backend: 120 JUnit 5 + Mockito tests (services and controllers), run with:

```bash
cd backendProjecty
./mvnw test
```

The Maven build fails if JaCoCo measures under 70% line coverage in any package (`jacoco-maven-plugin`, `check` goal) — a real, enforced gate, not just a report.

Frontend: ESLint (`npm run lint`) and a production build (`npm run build`) as a smoke check; no component test suite yet.

---

## Deployment

The backend deploys to **Render** as a Docker web service; the frontend deploys to **Netlify** as a static build. They're independent services that talk to each other over `VITE_API_URL` / `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

### Backend → Render

1. Push this repo to GitHub (already done if you're reading this on GitHub).
2. In Render: **New → Blueprint**, point it at this repo — it picks up [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) and creates the `projectii-backend` Docker web service.
   - No blueprint? Create it manually instead: **New → Web Service**, runtime **Docker**, Dockerfile path `backendProjecty/Dockerfile`, Docker context `backendProjecty`.
3. Create a Postgres instance (Render Postgres, or any managed Postgres — Neon and Supabase both work).
4. Set these environment variables on the web service:
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` — `jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>`
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` — the blueprint auto-generates one; set your own if deploying manually
   - `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — your Netlify URL, e.g. `https://projectii.netlify.app`
5. Health check path is `/actuator/health` (already wired into `render.yaml` and the Dockerfile's `HEALTHCHECK`).

> Render's free plan has no persistent disk, so uploaded avatars won't survive a restart/redeploy. Fine for a demo; for real persistence, mount a paid disk or move avatar storage to S3-compatible object storage.

### Frontend → Netlify

1. In Netlify: **Add new site → Import an existing project**, pick this repo — it picks up [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml) (base directory `frontendProjecty`, build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`, SPA redirect to `index.html`).
2. Site settings → Environment variables: set `VITE_API_URL` to the Render backend URL from above.
3. Deploy. Once you have the Netlify URL, go back to Render and set `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to it (they reference each other, so the backend needs to be told about the frontend's final URL).

## API Overview

Global prefix: `/api/v1`. All routes except `/auth/**` and `GET /uploads/**` require a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

| Resource | Base path |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | `/auth` — register, login |
| Users | `/users/me` — profile read/update, avatar upload |
| Terms & Courses | `/terms`, `/courses` |
| Tasks | `/tasks` |
| Notes | `/notes` |
| Focus Rooms | `/focus-rooms` — create, join, invite, rematch (live session runs over STOMP, not REST) |
| Friends | `/friends`, `/friends/requests` |
| Notifications | `/notifications` |
